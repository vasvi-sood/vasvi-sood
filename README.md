### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/vasvisood"><img height="30" src="assets/code.png"></a> My name is Vasvi Sood, and I am currently in my third year of college. I enjoy pushing my brain to think about complex problems. That's why I like competitive programming so much.

- On a clear, breezy day, I enjoy going for a bicycle ride. On my idle days, I would curl up on the couch with a good book to read.

- <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Vasvi-Sood"><img height="30" src="assets/book.png"></a> I also write short stories and poetries ocassionally.

- My motto is "wake up, dress up, and work for your passions," followed by a crazy weekend of travelling and exploring.
